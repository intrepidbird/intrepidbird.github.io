<!-- Passions -->
<div class="container p-4">
    <h2>Passions</h2>
    <p>
        I am a math lover who has succeeded and won awards in prestigious math competitions like the AMC series, AIME, ARML, MathCounts, CML, Math League, and others. I also enjoy science and have won tournaments like the Logistem Science Challeger, the Science Bowl, and others. I'm also a 2x hackathon winner, an informatics tournament top scorer, a cybersecurity competition winner, and I create coding projects available to the public on my web domain and open source platforms. My interests within computer science lie mostly in web development, but I also write lots of mathematical and scientific Python code and am interested in robotics. Besides all my STEM interests, I also enjoy reading nonfiction, hanging out with friends, playing ice hockey, tennis, table tennis, band instruments, and watching logic-based and sci-fi movies.
    </p>
</div>
    
<!-- Math -->
<div class="container p-4">
    <h2>Mathematics</h2>
    <p>
        My primary passion is mathematics, where I captain my school's Math Competition Team (4th in Chapter), am a 3x AMC 8 honor roll achiever, was in the top 10 in my chapter for MathCounts, was #1 in my region with my team for CML, achieved a perfect score on the Math League competition, and am a 2x Gauss Math Tournament top scorer. My favorite subjects in math are algebra and combinatorics, as algebra seems like the most logical of all the mathematical disciplines and combinatorics is often amongst the most difficult. I am also involved on Art of Problem Solving, a math forum, where I host a blog and occasionally play AoPS For The Win (FTW). I'm particularly interested in participating in high school math competitions next year and hoping to suceed in them (I am a rising freshman). I also plan to be an intern for LIVE by Po-Shen Loh, the former IMO head coach, next year (or maybe even this year). I serve as the founder of IntrepidMaths, which is a group of passionate and eager mathematicians who engage in enriching math discussions on Discord.

<!-- Science -->
<div class="container p-4">
    <h2>Sciences</h2>
    <p>
        I'm also really interested in science, and I captain my school's Science Bowl Team (2nd in New Jersey), am a Logistem Science Challenger Grand Champion in the highest division, and a 2x Logistem top 10 scorer, and was a 2x NJ Science Bowl runner-up (silver medal). My main focuses in science would be in the physical sciences and earth and space sciences. I enjoy physics partially because of the mathematical and precise aspects of the field, and I appreciate earth and space sciences thanks to Kurzgesagt: In a Nutshell, where I am a major contributer to on their Discord server. I'm also just interested in any type of science, and I like to read scientific books and articles written by authors such as Stephen Hawking and Neil deGrasse Tyson. I am interested in participating in the Science Bowl and other science competitions next year in high school as well.
    </p>

<!-- Coding -->
<div class="container p-4">
    <h2>Computer Science</h2>
    <p>
        Computer Science is a relatively new interest for me, but it's still a major one nonetheless. I am a co-founder of the Bridgewater-Raritan Computer Science Club (BRCS), where I teach Basic Python and Advanced Python to students in Bridgewater-Raritan who are passionate about coding and computer science. I have been a hackathon winner in both the BR Hackathon 2023 and RidgeHacks 2024, and I've been featured on newspaper posts due to my programming achievements. I am also part of the 4th-place middle school team at the 2023 Lexington Informatics Tournament. I enjoy making web projects (like this website), am fluent in Python, Javascript, HTML, CSS, and jQuery, and am learning C, C#, and C++. As for hackathons, I am primarily a front-end developer, but I am also capable of working on design, databases, and some back-end work. In addition, I have some experience with robotics competitions through FIRST and have a decent knowledge of robotics. I am trying to enter into competitive programming competitions, such as USACO and ACSL.</p>

<!-- Other -->
<div class="container p-4">
    <h2>Sports, Music, and Humanities</h2>
    <p>
        I'm obviously very STEM based at my core, but I also enjoy other things in life. My primary sport is ice hockey, where I play for the NJ Rockets U15 AA and Bridgewater-Raritan Middle School. Besides hockey, I also play tennis and soccer as recreational activities. I also enjoy playing table tennis with friends. I play snare drum and marimba in my school's concert band, and I used to play piano as well. I'm also a fluent Chinese speaker and enjoy learning about Chinese culture and history. I have won numerous awards for Chinese speaking, along with 3x Class Honors from Huaxia Chinese School.
