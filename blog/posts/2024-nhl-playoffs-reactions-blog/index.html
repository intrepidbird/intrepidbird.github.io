    <h2>Round 1:</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Carolina Hurricanes vs New York Islanders.</strong> Prediction: CAR 4-1. I didn't follow this series too closely, but I knew who won each game and who scored and so on. If you look at my bracket, I have Carolina going pretty far in the playoffs and I picked them to do so because of their original superstars and the trades they were able to pull of at the trade deadline. I think this was a nice series, but the Islanders really stood no chance against the Hurricanes in the long run.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Boston Bruins vs Toronto Maple Leafs.</strong> Prediction: BOS 4-0. Honestly I thought this was going to be a sweep in Boston's favor, but like all matchups between these two teams, it went to a game 7. I actually followed this the most out of any first round playoff matchup, and I was very interested in watching these games and monitoring the scores. I watched Boston take the first game with a wide margin and thought that my prediction was secure and that Boston was going to destroy the Leafs, but then the Leafs came back from a 3-1 deficit and managed to pull out game 7, which ended up giving Boston the series win. Overall, my bracket is still safe, as Boston wins, but it was a nailbiter, with the Bruins almost choking a lead again.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>New York Rangers vs Washington Capitals.</strong> Prediction: NYR 4-0. Easy sweep in my opinion, Washington had no chance at all, they had a lead for like less than 10 minutes in the whole series. I doubt that anyone had much doubt that this was either Rangers in 4 or Rangers in 5.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Florida Panthers vs Tampa Bay Lightining.</strong> Prediction: FLA 4-3. Okay, I thought the Lightning were going to put up a tougher fight, given their star-studded core of Kucherov (Art Ross Winner), Stamkos, and Vasilevskiy, but Florida came out on top in almost every game and were just a better team overall in this series. Florida looks kind of like the beast they were last year, and that might be a slight problem because I have them getting knocked out in the second round by Boston, who slipped up in games 5 and 6, and almost lost a lead.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Edmonton Oilers vs Los Angeles Kings.</strong> Prediction: EDM 4-2. This was honestly pretty close, but Edmonton took the win in just 5 games. The Oilers power play is looking really promising for my bracket, because I picked Edmonton to go all the way and take the cup. I think McDavid and Draisaitl are playing like crazy during the playoffs, and Hyman also showed why he's a 50 goal scorer, and showed up when it mattered most. The Oiler's defense is also solid, and their goalie is pretty good, so all things considered they did not give the Kings a chance in this series, and they look like a team that can take Vancouver in 6 next round.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Vancouver Canucks vs Nashville Predators.</strong> Prediction: VAN 4-2. Now I know some people thought the Canucks were frauds and were just lucky in the regular season, but their game 4 comeback was too good to ignore. Most of their star players are showing up, and they've been solid so far, but I just don't think they have what it takes to beat a top Stanley Cup Contender in the second round.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Winnepeg Jets vs Colorado Avalanche.</strong> Prediction: COL 4-3. The Colorado offence was destroying the Jets in terms of shots and goals. They scored over 5 goals per game, which is crazy, and their defensive core is lead by the best defenseman in the NHL. They were able to beat a Vezina level goaltender with realtive ease, and I think they have what it takes to reach the Western Conference Final.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Dallas Stars vs Vegas Golden Knights.</strong> Prediction: DAL 4-2. Honestly good for Dallas for winning the series. I picked them on my bracket and it paid off. The Vegas Golden Knights have done enough damage with their exploits and it's great that the Stars shut them down. However, given that they're playing the Avalanche next, I think they will get beaten by the sheer force of the Avalanche attack and locked down by the Avs defensive game.
