    <h1>Becoming the Grand Champion at Logistem's Science Challenger!</h1>

    When I was in 6th grade, I got 2nd place at the annual Logistem Science Challenger tournament in the grades 5-6 division. In 7th grade, I got 7th place in the grades 7-8 division. This year, in 8th grade, I finally won 1st place in the top division of the Logistem Science Challenger!
  </p>
  <p>
      After my first taste of victory two years ago, I realized I always did well in the written round, but the pressure typically got to me in the countdown round. In the tournament, you get to choose two written tests of 30 questions each in 30 minutes. The options are always Life Science, Physical Science, and Earth and Space Science. That year, I had picked Life Science and Earth and Space Science as my two categories. I had the highest score in Earth and Space Science that year, with the only perfect score, and a top 3 score in Life Science. This ensured that I entered the countdown bracket at the #1 seed position. However, a low seed defeated everyone in his way, including me, in a 1-2 (best of 3) loss for me. I ended up winning the 2nd place overall prize, and the Earth and Space Science #1 prize.
  </p>
  <p>
      The next year, after I had won silver in the New Jersey Middle School Science Bowl with BRMS, I competed again, but in the 7-8th grade division, as per my grade level. I chose Physical Science and Earth and Space Science because I would have to main Physics and Math next year in Science Bowl, and I was good at Earth and Space Science, as shown from last year. I did fairly well on the written test, getting 3rd place in Earth and Space Science and 1st in Physical Science. However, even though I was 1st in Physics, nobody got a perfect score in the Physical Sciences test. In fact, I found out that Physics is the lowest scoring category of them all, and not a good choice if you want to get a high seed placement. Once again, I lost in the countdown round due to a reverse sweep (just like the year before), and finished 7th overall (I was 6th seed to enter the bracket). I ended up winning the 7th place overall prize and the Physical Science #1 prize. It is worth mentioning that as a 7th grader, I beat my captain for Science Bowl who was a 8th grader (Saharsh Bangaru finished 11th overall).
  </p>
  <p>
      This year, after my 2nd silver medal in the NJ Science Bowl (most in BRMS history), this time as the captain, I had my sights set on winning the highest division of the tournament. I picked Earth and Space Science and Life Science, the two highest-scoring categories, and ended up getting 1st in Life Science, and 3rd in Earth and Space Science. I once again entered the knockout / countdown bracket as the 1st overall seed, but this time I swept my opponent, Colin Ding in the final, 2-0. I finally won the entire tournament. I ended up as the Grand Champion (#1 Overall) and 1st in Life Science.
  </p>
  <p>
      I think it's come pretty full circle now. I'm now the all-time most decorated for BRMS in the Science Bowl (2x Silver Medals), winning half my school's Science Bowl honors in merely 2 years, the Logistem Grand Champion, and a winner of all categories in the Logistem Science Challenger (Earth and Space #1 in 2022, Physics #1 in 2023, and Biology #1 in 2024).
  </p>
  <p>
      It's been a wonderful ride and let's remember that without a National Science Bowl Championship, the job's not finished.
